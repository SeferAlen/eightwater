        "text1": "People nowadays pay great attention to the quality of water that is used for drinking and people do purification of the water before using it, using very expensive purification methods. Therefore, Rational exploitation of the ecologically and clean spring waters in very important from the economic and ecologic aspect.That's why we took a step into exploitation and use quality spring water, such as 'Husica vrelo'-Duboka in Bugojno Municipality",

        "text9": "The minimal filtration process serves only to remove fine particles, while leaving beneficial minerals intact. The water is never treated with chemicals or anything that affects the water’s quality. EIGHT Spring water is pure, crisp and has delicious flavour. It is exceptionally refreshing and contains so many naturally occurring beneficial minerals.",

        "text13": "The research about the stability of water after bottling is conducted for the needs of the project on producing the bottled water from source 'Husica vrelo'-Duboka. This is presented in the study of quality, stability and opportunities of bottling spring water 'Husica vrelo'-Duboka, which results show that the water is stable and appropriate for bottling. Those data are used in this pre-study on the economic justifiability. Research results show that during the certain time period there is no change of concentration of components that are present in the water and there are no chemical and transformation processes, no color change or precipitation. Therefore it might be concluded that the water is stable in defined research time and advisable for bottling in PET (plastic) and glass packaging.",

        "descrT3": "The location of the source of the Husic water spring is Deep in the municipality of Bugojno, SBK-Central Bosnia Canton, Federation of BiH and is 6 km away from the town of Bugojno. The mentioned source is, in hydrogeological sense, an overflow of a large karst reservoir and is located in the area of ​​karst massifs. The specificity of this source is the mechanism of springs, that is, the appearance of water at the source itself, so that water can be drunk directly from the source, without any further technological processes. It is a catchment area that is uninhabited, so access is very convenient, as is the environment of the well itself. In terms of abundance ie. the amount of water flow, so far, tests have shown that the minimum water flow is about 211 liters per second. There was a slight change in the water yield depending on the season, which indicates that the relative stability of the source means that the water flows from greater depths to which there is no significant influence of atmospheric water, which appears to a greater or lesser extent. This means that the average water flow of a spring of 200 liters per second can be discussed. Furthermore, the water from this source is of high quality in terms of its chemical and microbiological characteristics, bearing in mind the following:\n\n- the content of substances in water, especially nitrates found in low concentrations and nitrites whose concentrations are below the limit of study, make this water extremely high quality and suitable for drinking,\n- water that contains minimal amounts of chloride, sulfate, nitrite and phosphate, and the organic matter is present in negligible concentrations,\n- the content of heavy metals in this water is very low, far below the maximum permissible limit values,\n- from the point of view of the presence of pathogenic microorganisms, the water is hygienically correct.\n\n The results of water testing so far have shown that with the time of standing of water there are no chemical processes, that is, the change of water color and the appearance of sediment, so it can be concluded that the water is stable and very suitable for bottling. Considering all of the above, it can be concluded that the water from the Husić spring is of high quality, it is stable after bottling and that it fulfills all the conditions regulated by the current regulations on natural spring waters and the health of the water",
